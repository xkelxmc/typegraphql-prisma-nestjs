## Feedback

Currently released version `0.x` is just a preview of the upcoming integration. For now it lacks some customization option - picking models or fields of object types to expose in the schema, hiding input fields as well as picking exposed args fields. However, the base functionality is working well, so I strongly encourage you to give it a try and play with it.

Any feedback about the developers experience or ideas about new features or enhancements are very welcome - please feel free to put your two cents by using the [GitHub Discussions feature](https://github.com/MichalLytek/typegraphql-prisma/discussions/new):
