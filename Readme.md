# Fork of [typegraphql-prisma](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typegraphql-prisma)

This project is a fork of another with minor changes, created for personal use.

Long term support is not guaranteed, use of this copy is at your own risk.

## Installation

```

## Differences from the original project:

### Functions and classes used in generated files from scheme of [prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma), imports from [nestjs](https://nestjs.com)

# TypeGraphQL & Prisma integration

Prisma generator to emit TypeGraphQL types and CRUD resolvers from your Prisma schema.

[**https://prisma.typegraphql.com/**](https://prisma.typegraphql.com/)

## Documentation

The documentation, installation guide, detailed description of the API and all of its features is [available on the website](https://prisma.typegraphql.com/).

## Examples

You can check out some usage examples on this repo:

https://github.com/EndyKaufman/typegraphql-prisma-nestjs-example

## Feedback

Currently released version `0.x` is just a preview of the upcoming integration. For now it lacks some customization option - picking models or fields of object types to expose in the schema, hiding input fields as well as picking exposed args fields. However, the base functionality is working well, so I strongly encourage you to give it a try and play with it.

Any feedback about the developers experience or ideas about new features or enhancements are very welcome - please feel free to put your two cents by using the [GitHub Discussions feature](https://github.com/MichalLytek/typegraphql-prisma/discussions/new):
